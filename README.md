# olive_public_seq
This folder contains files associated with the reanalysis of publicly available olive leaf RNA-seq data.

### PRJNA209941
Data from doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0073674.

Data do not appear to be paired-end as authors state in the manuscript. Authors do no state from which tissue olive RNA was extracted, but because DNA was extracted from leaf, I assume it was leaf. 

### PRJEB4992
Data from DOI:10.1186/s13742-016-0134-5.
Only one mature olive sample, but paired-end and ~80M reads
