Split paired-end reads and concatenate single-end reads with left reads

**NB check the names of the single end reads before running this!**
```
for file in ../diginorm/*.pe.qc.keep.abundfilt.fq.gz
do
   split-paired-reads.py ${file}
done

cat *.1 > left.fq
cat *.2 > right.fq

gunzip -c ../diginorm/orphaned-and-single-reads.keep.abundfilt.fq.gz >> left.fq
```

Assemble with Trinity

Upgrade to r4.8xlarge
