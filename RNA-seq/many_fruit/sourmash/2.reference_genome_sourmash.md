Some fungal hashes were identified from unaligned hisat reads. See if there is contamination in the reference genome from fungal genomes that are in the 1000KFG index. 

Begin by downloading the reference genome and computing a signature on it. 
```
mkdir /mnt/work/ref_genome
cd ref_genome
wget http://denovo.cnag.cat/genomes/olive/download/Oe6/Oe6.scaffolds.fa.gz
source ~/sourmashEnv2/bin/activate
sourmash compute -k 21,31,51 -o Oe6.scaffolds.fa.sig --scaled 500 Oe6.scaffolds.fa.gz
```
