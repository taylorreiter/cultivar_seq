Reads were quality trimmed with trimmomatic (see pre-processing docs one level up). Now, trim reads with khmer `trim-low-abund.py` with `--variable-coverage` indicated.

Use `pondenv` khmer to trim reads. 

Organize and link in trimmed reads
```
cd /mnt/work/
mkdir
sourmash
cd sourmash
mkdir signatures
cd signatures
ln -s /mnt/work/*/quality/*qc.fq.gz .
```

Delete the non-interleaved paired in reads
```
rm *_1* *_2*
```

Concatenate interleaved reads with orphaned reads and remove non-concatenated files
```
cat ERR1346597.pe.qc.fq.gz orphans.qc.fq.gz > ERR1346597.pe+orphans.qc.fq.gz
rm ERR1346597.pe.qc.fq.gz orphans.qc.fq.gz
```

Run `khmer`, and remove every kmer that does not have an absolute coverage of at least 3
```
trim-low-abund.py -k 21 -C 3 -M 15e9 --variable-coverage *qc.fq.gz
```
