Reads were quality trimmed with trimmomatic (see pre-processing docs one level up). Now, trim reads with khmer `trim-low-abund.py` with `--variable-coverage` indicated.

Use `pondenv` khmer to trim reads. 

Organize and link in trimmed reads
```
cd /mnt/work/
mkdir
sourmash
cd sourmash
mkdir trim-low-abund-v
cd trim-low-abund-v
ln -s /mnt/work/*/quality/*qc.fq.gz .
```

Delete the non-interleaved paired in reads
```
rm *_1* *_2*
```

Concatenate interleaved reads with orphaned reads and remove non-concatenated files
```
cat ERR1346597.pe.qc.fq.gz orphans.qc.fq.gz > ERR1346597.pe+orphans.qc.fq.gz
rm ERR1346597.pe.qc.fq.gz orphans.qc.fq.gz
```

Run `khmer`, and remove every kmer that does not have an absolute coverage of at least 3
```
trim-low-abund.py -k 21 -C 3 -M 15e9 --variable-coverage *qc.fq.gz
```

Make signatures from error-corrected reads
```
cd /mnt/work/sourmash
mkdir signatures
cd signatures
ln -s ../trim-low-abund-v/*abundtrim .
for infile in *abundtrim
    do
        sourmash compute -k 21,31,51 -o ${infile}.sig --track-abundance --scaled 10000 ${infile}
done
```

Because kaiju failed to detect format, change names and see if kaiju succeeds. This effects sourmash because the linked in files will no longer have filled links, they will be empty because file names will have changed. 
```
for infile in *abundtrim.gz
do 
    j=$(basename $infile .fq.gz.abundtrim.gz)
    echo $j
    mv $infile ${j}.abundtrim.fq.gz
done
```

Kaiju was still unhappy. Unzip the files
```
for infile in *abundtrim.fq.gz
do
    gunzip ${infile}
done
```
Rezip the files
```
for infile in abundtrim.fq 
do
    gzip $infile
done
```

And, because the third time's the charm (or rather, because I updated sourmash and want everything to work well), recalculate signatures of files one more time, at a `--scaled 1000` and with `-k 21,31,51` to be compatible with the new index.

```
cd /mnt/work/sourmash
mkdir signatures3
cd signatures3
ln -s ../trim-low-abund-v/*gz

for infile in *gz
do
    sourmash compute -k 21,31,51 --scaled 1000 -o $infile.sig3 $infile
done
```
```
