Update sourmash from github. Delete all signatures, and rerun. 

Run `sourmash sbt_gather` on the quality controlled olive fruit reads. 

Here, quality controlled is defined as trimmomatic and khmer `trim-low-abund --variable coverage <...>` (see 0.preprocessing).

```
cd /mnt/work/sourmash
mkdir sbt_gather
cd sbt_gather
ln -s ../signatures/*sig .
```

```
source ~/sourmashEnv2/bin/activate
for infile in *.sig
  do
    sourmash sbt_gather -k 31 ~/sourmash_SBTs/fungal_4.13.17.sbt.json --threshold=0.001 -o fungal_k31_${infile}.txt ${infile}
 done
```

Run sourmash again...the first few files were empty and I'm skeptical of this
```
for infile in *.sig
  do
    sourmash sbt_gather -k 31 ~/sourmash_SBTs/fungal_4.13.17.sbt.json --threshold=0.001 -o fungal_trial2_k31_${infile}.txt ${infile}
 done
 ```

Check for reference genome content
```
cd /mnt/work/sourmash/sbt_gather
source ~/sourmashEnv2/bin/activate
for infile in *.sig
  do
    sourmash sbt_gather -k 31 ~/sourmash_SBTs/olive_ref/olive_ref_4.18.17.sbt.json --threshold=0.001 -o olive_k31_${infile}.txt ${infile}
 done
```

Run against the k31 microbes sbt to see what is present other than fungus
Need to re-run this. 
```
for infile in *.sig
  do
    sourmash sbt_gather -k 31 ~/sourmash_SBTs/microbes.k31.sbt.json --threshold=0.001 -o microbe_k31_${infile}.txt ${infile}
done
```
