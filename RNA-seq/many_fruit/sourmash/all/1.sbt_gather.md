Run `sourmash sbt_gather` on the quality controlled olive fruit reads. 

Here, quality controlled is defined as trimmomatic and khmer `trim-low-abund --variable coverage <...>` (see 0.preprocessing).

```
cd /mnt/work/sourmash
mkdir sbt_gather
cd sbt_gather
ln -s ../signatures/*sig .
```

```
source ~/sourmashEnv2/bin/activate
for infile in *.sig
  do
    sourmash sbt_gather -k 31 ~/sourmash_SBTs/fungal_4.13.17.sbt.json ${infile} --threshold=0.001 -o fungal_k31_${infile}.txt
 done
