Run SSUsearch on trimmed, abundance filtered RNA-seq reads to detect ribosomal RNA for 16s (and ITS?) sequences.

Link in qc'd abundance trimmed reads (see preprocessing for trimmomatic sourmash folder for trim-low-abund for code on how this was done)
```
cd /mnt/work
mkdir SSUsearch
cd SSUsearch
ln -s /mnt/work/sourmash/trim-low-abund/*abundtrim .
```

Convert sequences to fasta format (format required for SSUsearch)
```
for infile in *abundtrim
do
  fastq_to_fasta -i $infile > ${infile}.fa
done
```
