Calculate the genome signature of each of the scaffolds in Oe6. See if any scaffolds differ, and if so, if these are the same scaffolds that were identified by BLAST as having fungal content.

calculate di, tri, tetra, and penta nucleotide frequencies of olive scaffolds. Use scaled 10kbp; resolution not necessary.
```
cd /mnt/work/ref_genome
mkdir scaffolds
cd scaffolds
ln -s ../Oe6.scaffolds.fa .

awk '/>Oe6_s/{n++}{print > n ".scaffold.fa" }' Oe6.scaffolds.fa

for infile in *scaffold.fa
do
  sourmash compute -k 2,3,4,5 --scaled 10000 --track-abundance -o ${infile}.s1000.k2-5.sig ${infile}
done
```
