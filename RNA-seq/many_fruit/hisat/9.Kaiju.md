This step was actually run have step 3 in this folder to assess whether it was worth my time to continue on with this analysis. 

The kaiju database was constructed as described here (https://gist.github.com/taylorreiter/2511b0c6e904b455e7002742c5da1492). 

Kaiju was then run on each of the samples.

First, folders were made, files were organized, etc.
```
cd /mnt/work/hisat/unaligned/
mkdir kaiju
cd kaiju
ln -s ../megahit/*megahit* .
```

Run kaiju on the contig files
```
for infile in ./*/final.contigs.fa
    do
    j=$(dirname $infile)
    k=$(basename $j)
        ~/kaiju/bin/kaiju -t ~/kaijudb_e/nodes.dmp -f ~/kaijudb_e/kaiju_db_nr_euk.fmi -i ${infile} -v -o kaijudb_e_${k}.out
 done
```

Add names
```
for infile in *out
    do
        ~/kaiju/bin/addTaxonNames -t ~/kaijudb_e/nodes.dmp -n ~/kaijudb_e/names.dmp -i ${infile} -o ${infile}.names
done
```

Then make kaiju summary report
```
for infile in *out
    do
        ~/kaiju/bin/kaijuReport -t  ~/kaijudb_e/nodes.dmp -n  ~/kaijudb_e/names.dmp -i ${infile} -r genus -o ${infile}.summary
done
```

Convert files to be krona compatible
```
for infile in *out
    do
        ~/kaiju/bin/kaiju2krona -t  ~/kaijudb_e/nodes.dmp -n ~/kaijudb_e/names.dmp -i ${infile} -o ${infile}.krona
done
```

Run krona on kaiju output for simple visualization
```
 for infile in *krona
    do 
        ktImportText -o ${infile}.html ${infile}
done
```
