# In my further attempt to ID things that are not olive in these samples, I am trying sourmash SBT_gather "using microbes.sbt.json". 
# CSV listing what is in the SBT (NB SBT stands for sequence bloom tree)

# Actual file containing the SBT signatures

# Outline
    # Unmount AWS instance with data. 
    # Create new AWS instance. 
    # download sourmash, SBT signatures, etc. 
    # Mount drive 
    # Run Sourmash on reads that did not align to the olive reference genome (~18% of the original fastq files). 

# Commence!

pip install sourmash
