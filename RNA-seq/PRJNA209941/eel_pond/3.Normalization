Make sure data is in the right place
```
set -u
printf "\nMy QC-trimmed files are in $PROJECT/quality/, and consist of $(ls -1 ${PROJECT}/quality/*qc.fq.gz | wc -l) files\n\n"
set +u

Digital normalization
```
cd ${PROJECT}
mkdir -p diginorm
cd diginorm
ln -s ../quality/*qc.fq.gz .
```
```
 normalize-by-median.py --ksize 20 --cutoff 20 -M 15e9 --savegraph normC20k20.ct *qc.fq.gz
```

Filter erroneous **k-mers**
```
filter-abund.py -V -Z 18 normC20k20.ct *.keep
```
 
Rename files
```
for file in *.abundfilt
do
  newfile=${file%%.fq.gz.keep.abundfilt}.keep.abundfilt.fq
  mv ${file} ${newfile}
  gzip ${newfile}
done
```

Scared that files will all be deleted, make a copy.
```
for infile in *qc.keep.abundfilt.fq.gz; do cp ${infile} ~/backup/${infile}; done 
```

Upgrade to m4.4xlarge
Re-source environgment
Reset $PROJECT
```
export PROJECT=/mnt/work
```
Check that files are in the right place.
```
set -u
printf "\nMy diginormed files are in $PROJECT/diginorm/, and consist of $(ls -1 ${PROJECT}/diginorm/*.keep.abundfilt.fq.gz | wc -l) files\n\n"
