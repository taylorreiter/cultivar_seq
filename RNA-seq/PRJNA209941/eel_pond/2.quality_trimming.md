Build Illumina adapter file
```
cd ~/projects/eelpond
nano Illumina-adaptors.fa
```

see file that was made:

https://github.com/taylorreiter/cultivar_seq/blob/master/RNA-seq/Illumina-adaptors.fa


navigate to quality directory
```
cd /mnt/work/quality
```

link data to new workspace
```
ln -s ../cultivars/*.fastq.gz .
```

check to make sure it worked
```
printf "I see $(ls -1 *.fastq.gz | wc -l) files here.\n"
```

Move adapter file
```
mv /mnt/work/eelpond/Illumina-adaptors.fa Illumina-adaptors.fa
```

#### Trimming!

Skip the file that was already trimmed in the test run:
```
for filename in SRR926282.fastq.gz SRR926283.fastq.gz  SRR926285.fastq.gz  SRR926287.fastq.gz SRR926284.fastq.gz  SRR926286.fastq.gz
do
     # first, make the base by removing fastq.gz
     base=$(basename $filename .fastq.gz)
     echo $base
```

finally, run Trimmomatic
```
     TrimmomaticSE ${base}.fastq.gz ${base}qc.fq.gz ILLUMINACLIP:Illumina-adaptors.fa:2:40:15 LEADING:2 TRAILING:2 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:2 MINLEN:25
done
```

make it hard to mess files up
```
chmod u-w ${PROJECT}/quality/*qc.fq.gz
```
