### Digital Normalization
Activate the environment in which khmer was installed
```
source ~/pondenv/bin/activate
```
Link in qc'd reads from paired and single in data. These are both in folders named quality, so all reads should be linked in this way. 
```
cd /mnt/work/
mkdir eelpond
cd eelpond
mkdir -p diginorm
cd diginorm
ln -s /mnt/work/*/quality/*qc.fq.gz .
rm ERR1346597_2.qc.fq.gz ERR1346597_1.qc.fq.gz
```
khmer will expect all reads to be paired end, except one file that contains "orphaned" reads that are single end. This is the orphan file created during preprocessing. Concatenate the orphan file to the single end fastq files (note there are 8 single-end fastq files, and one orphan file). 
```
gunzip -c orphan* SRR* > orphaned-and-single-reads.qc.fq.gz
```
Apply digital normailzation
```
normalize-by-median.py -p -k 20 -C 20 -M 14e9 \
 --savegraph normC20k20.ct -u orphaned-and-single-reads.qc.fq.gz \
 *.pe.qc.fq.gz
```

Trim erroneous kmers
```
filter-abund.py -V -Z 18 normC20k20.ct *.keep && \
  rm *.keep normC20k20.ct
```

Break out orphaned and still-paired reads
```
for infile in *.pe.*.abundfilt
do
  extract-paired-reads.py ${infile}
done

# output ERR1346597.pe.qc.fq.gz.keep.abundfilt.se & ERR1346597.pe.qc.fq.gz.keep.abundfilt.pe
```

Concatenate all orphaned reads and all single end reads:
```
cat ERR1346597.pe.qc.fq.gz.keep.abundfilt.se >> orphaned-and-single-reads.qc.fq.gz.keep.abundfilt
```

So now, going in to assembly, the two files with all of the reads are:
 + `orphaned-and-single-reads.qc.fq.gz.keep.abundfilt`: single end reads and orphaned reads (both from qc and diginorm)
 + `ERR1346597.pe.qc.fq.gz.keep.abundfilt.pe`: paired end diginorm reads
